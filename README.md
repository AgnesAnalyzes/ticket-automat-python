# Ticket Sales Simulation – Python Project

**Goal:**  
A simple Python program that simulates a daily ticket sale, where a maximum of 20 tickets can be sold per day.  
The script uses loops and conditional statements to manage user input and track available tickets.

## How It Works

1. The program starts with `tickets_ist = 0` (tickets sold) and `tickets_übrig = 20` (tickets available).  
2. The user is asked how many tickets they would like to buy.  
3. The program checks:
   - whether the requested number exceeds the daily limit,  
   - whether tickets are still available,  
   - and when the sale should end.  
4. After each valid purchase, the program updates and displays the remaining number of tickets.  
5. Once all 20 tickets are sold, the program ends automatically.

## Concepts Used

- **Loops** (`while`)  
- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- **User input** (`input()`)  
- **Variables and numeric operations**
